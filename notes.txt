// TODO: Rewrite `LIST()` and assorted functions to go off of the new `INFO` map. 
// TODO: Make it `just-work` when you feed it a playlist. 
// TODO: Add functionality to delete commands. \/\/.
// TODO: Add delete interactions feature in `initialize_commands()` in `utility.js`. 
// TODO: Make sure that `play` isn't fucking things up, test it good. 
// TODO: Make SILLY_MODE and all the rest `const` in `commands.js`, somehow. 
// TODO: Make it not shit itself and die when it doesn't receive a string in response from a function it calls. 
// TODO: Stop passing `player` in the constructor and just initialize it therein instead. 
// TODO: Resolve all the `Doofopoly`s. 
// !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
// TODO: Change everything from `ytdl` to `play-dl`, particularly the functions that get song information. 
// TODO: Fix things so that `play_front()` isn't `async` anymore, it's dumb!  Fix all the `await play_front()`s. 
// TODO: Add functionality to change the maximum PLAYLIST and HISTORY lengths: max(_,_) them against some reasonable ABSOLUTE_MAX... value. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "FINDABETTERWAY."
// TODO: CTRL+F "Thisthing."
// TODO: CTRL+F "Find a better way to do this."
// TODO: CTRL+F "ONE+1".
// TODO: THIS IS A GOOD ONE.  Add a `move` function that moves a song from somewhere in the playlist to somewhere else.
// TODO: Make `remove_non_URL_characters` better. 
// TODO: Consider what global variables should be `const` and assign them appropriately. 
// TODO: Fix that damnable `async` nonsense that's going on in the `cmd.list` function! 
// TODO: Pick some more careful names for the `argv`s. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "Fix later." 
// TODO: Add a function to remove videos by URL/title/whatever. 
// TODO: You know, `halt` would be a good name for something.  We should use that. 
// TODO: Rename `abscond` to `leave`? 
// TODO: Make `LOG` betterer. 
// TODO: Have it send a message every time it starts playing a new song?  That'd be a trick.  Send it to the last channel it received a command from, maybe? 
// TODO: Fix the fact that disabling autoplay doesn't actually disable autoplay if it's enabled when you `push` but not when you `join`. 
// TODO: Delete `affirm`? 
// TODO: Figure out what the hell went wrong with `skip`. 
// TODO: Make `amai` capable of reading excessively long messages, even though there's really no use case for it. 
// TODO: Jump ahead in the playlist to some index. 

//TEST: 
// TEST: Re-order the list that the commands go in. 
// TEST: Add functionality such that only users with a certain role can operate the bot, or at least the volume. 
// TEST: Fix bug where if you enter commands too fast, particularly `list`, it just crashes and dies. 
// TEST: Make sure that LOOP and LOOP_FRONT can't both be set at the same time. 
// TEST: Functions `loop` and `keep`! 
// TEST: Clean up `accrue`.
// TEST: Fix the critical v14 bug! 
// TEST: Fix the fact that adding playlists can grossly overload the playlist limit. 
// TEST: Add ff/rwd. 

//NOTE:
// NOTE: Weird things happen with a FADE_TIME of `0`, locked it to `ONE` with a Math.min. 

//DONE: 
// DONE: Consider replacing every `interaction.reply` with a function that `interaction.reply`s and ALSO logs it to the console; might be cleaner. 
// DONE: Implement YouTube search function. 
// DONE: Call `TALK_TIME` `debouncer` instead? 
// DONE: Implement `abscond`. 
// DONE: Have `join` throw an error message if the user isn't in a voice channel. 
// DONE: Rename `stop` to `pause`. 
// DONE: Make `TALK_TIME` linear and implement it more thoroughly.
