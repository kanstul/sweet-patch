// TODO: Affirm commands by voice. 
// TODO: Make it not shit itself and die when it doesn't receive a string in response from a function it calls. 
// TODO: Implement YouTube search function. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "HEY_FIX_ME".
// !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
// TODO: CTRL+F "DOING SOME ODD THINGS TO MAKE IT WORK."
// TODO: Fix the fact that `insert` can overload the playlist, make it safe like `jump` and `push` are. 
// TODO: Change everything from `ytdl` to `play-dl`, particularly the functions that get song information. 
// TODO: Fix things so that `play_front()` isn't `async` anymore, it's dumb!  Fix all the `await play_front()`s. 
// TODO: Add functionality to change the maximum PLAYLIST and HISTORY lengths: max(_,_) them against some reasonable ABSOLUTE_MAX... value. 
// TODO: Fix the stupid try-catch block that's making `get_timestamp()` work. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "Thisthing."
// TODO: Play from timestamp! 
// TODO: CTRL+F "YAWNY".
// TODO: CTRL+F "REALLY MOVE". 
// TODO: Consider adding "CURRENTLY_PLAYING" to the `list` command. 
// TODO: Clean up the file directory. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "Find a better way to do this."
// TODO: THIS IS A GOOD ONE.  Add a `move` function that moves a song from somewhere in the playlist to somewhere else.  Will be easier if we rewrite everything to work by `!eval`ing. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "But why not?"
// TODO: Implement `abscond`. 
// TODO: Have `interaction.reply` by voice. 
// TODO: Make `remove_non_URL_characters` better. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "TAGYOUIT."
// TODO: Consider what global variables should be `const` and assign them appropriately. 
// TODO: Fix that damnable `async` nonsense that's going on in the `cmd.list` function! 
// TODO: Pick some more careful names for the `argv`s. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "Some other time."
// TODO: CTRL+F "Fix later." 
// TODO: Add a function to remove videos by URL/title/whatever. 
// TODO: CTRL+F "Fixthis."
// TODO: Put commands in separate file. 
// TODO: Have `join` throw an error message if the user isn't in a voice channel. 

//TEST: 
// TEST: Re-order the list that the commands go in. 
// TEST: Add functionality such that only users with a certain role can operate the bot, or at least the volume. 
// TEST: Fix bug where if you enter commands too fast, particularly `list`, it just crashes and dies. 
// TEST: Consider replacing every `interaction.reply` with a function that `interaction.reply`s and ALSO logs it to the console; might be cleaner. 
// TEST: Functions `loop` and `keep`! 
// TEST: Clean up `accrue`.
// TEST: Fix the critical v14 bug! 

//NOTE:
// NOTE: Weird things happen with a FADE_TIME of `0`, locked it to `ONE` with a Math.min. 

//DONE: 
// DONE: Add a function to insert a song at a given index. 
// DONE: Add a function that deletes a song given an index.  (Not hard; have headache.) 
// DONE: Add multiple songs with a single command. 
// DONE?: CTRL+F "syzygy" !!!!
// DONE: Add a function to delete the last song.  (What to name it?) 
// DONE: Overload the `play` function! 
// DONE: Make sure that LOOP and LOOP_FRONT can't both be set at the same time. 
// DONE: Delete all songs BETWEEN TWO GIVEN NUMBERS. 
// DONE: Fix CTRL+F "Dumbhack.". 
// DONE: CTRL+F "Weird bug."
// DONE?: Redo absolutely everything to use zero indexing. 
// DONE: CTRL+F "INVESTIGATE."
